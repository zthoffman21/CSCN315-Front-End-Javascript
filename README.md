For the project display, I designed the portfolio section to mimic Pok√©mon cards, each showcasing fun graphics and unique "attacks" that highlight specific features of each project. 
Using CSS and JavaScript, the cards are interactive, responding to mouse movements with hover effects, rotation, and a subtle glow to enhance user engagement.
